    <!-- EXERCISE 3
        For each album in the favorite list, place a badge on top of it with the genre of the album
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 4
        Create a section with an album tracklist inside a Bootstrap table.
        The row colors of the table must be alternated.

        There should be a column for the track order number, one for the title and one for the track duration.
        (If you want, you can also add extra columns)
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
        Add a DELETE bootstrap button at the end of each row of the tracklist. 
        Attach the functionality to remove its row when it gets clicked.  

        ##EXTRA##
        Make only one button visible at a time, for each row, when the single row gets hovered. 
        Animate it with a fade-in effect upon the user hovering and fade-out when he/she goes away from it.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
        Add an "Add Track" button under the tracklist of the album. 
        It should have a nice shadow transition when it gets hovered (with the box-shadow property) to look like 
        the button was elevating itself every time the user hovers onto it.        
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
        On the click of "Add Track" button, a modal should appear.
        (check in the documentation the modal+button example)
        
        The modal shall contain input fields with (avoid using a <form>):
        - Track number
        - Track title
        - Track duration
        - Track featuring
        - Live Track (checkbox)

        The fields should be inside an Input Group and divided in 2 columns.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
        The modal should contain 2 buttons at the bottom:
        - Add => Adds a new track in the tracklist with the data of the input fields.
        - Close => closes the modal

        https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/alerts/
        [EXTRA] Make the message disappear after 5 seconds
        https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
        Alert the user with a success message when the track gets added, or when a track gets deleted.
     -->


    <!-- ############### -->
    <!-- ###  EXTRA  ### -->
    <!-- ############### -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 9
         All the field (except for Feat. and Live Track) are required fields and require validation.
         If the user clicks on the Add button and some fields are empty, a warning alert must be shown
     -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
        Make sure the "Close" button clears out the input fields AND closes the modal
     -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 11
        Considering the "Add Track" functionality that you've created on ex. 8: 
         - The new list-element added to the list should appear with a fade-in effect
     -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 12
        Considering the button you've created in ex. 5 that deletes the row:
        Add a fade-out effect to the row before it gets removed, using a CSS transition effect
    -->
